					<p><b>The Elements</b> is a collection of definitions, 
					postulates (axioms), propositions (theorems and constructions), 
					and mathematical proofs of the propositions. It consists of 13 books 
					attributed to the greek mathematician Euclid at 300BC.</p>
					
					<p>Although many of Euclid's results had been stated by earlier mathematicians, 
					Euclid was the first to show how these propositions could fit into a comprehensive deductive and logical system.<br>
					His work stayed on top of the logical rigor for over two thousand years,
					being the second most published book in history and served as the 
					root of almost all mathematical branches.</p>
					
					<h3 id="e2">Euclid's Five Postulates</h3>
					<p>Near the beginning of the first book of the Elements, 
					Euclid gives <b>five postulates</b> (axioms) for 
					<b>Plane Geometry</b>, stated in terms of constructions:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>To draw a straight line from any point to any point.</li>
						<li>To produce (extend) a finite straight line continuously in a straight line.</li>
						<li>To describe a circle with any center and distance (radius).</li>
						<li>That all right angles are equal to one another.</li>
					</ol>	
					<img src="img/p4.jpg" class="center-align" alt="Postulates 1 through 4">
					<ol start=5>
						<li>That, if a straight line falling on two straight lines make the interior 
						angles on the same side less than two right angles, the two straight lines, 
						if produced indefinitely, meet on that side on which are the angles less 
						than the two right angles.</li>
					</ol>		
					<img src="img/p5.png" class="center-align" alt="Fifth Postulate">
					
					<h3 id="e3">The Parallel Postulate</h3>
					<figure class="right-align">
					<img src="img/john-playfair.jpeg" alt="John Playfair" id="playfair">
					<figcaption>John Playfair, <br>Scottish Mathematician</figcaption>
					</figure>
					
					<p>This last postullate is more commonly known today by it's equivalent, <i>Playfair's Axiom</i>, 
					named after the scottish John Playfair, and says as follows:</p>
					<ol start=5>
						<li><b>In a plane, given a line and a point outside of it, there is only one 
						parallel line to the given line that crosses the given point.</b></li>
					</ol>
					<img src="img/p5-a.jpg" class="center-align" alt="Playfair's Axiom">
					
					<p>For two thousand years, many attempts were made to prove the parallel postulate using Euclid's first four postulates. 
					The main reason that such a proof was so highly sought after was that, unlike the first four postulates, 
					the parallel postulate is not self-evident.</p>
					
					<p>Many attempts were made to prove the fifth postulate from the other four, 
					many of them being accepted as proofs for long periods of time until the mistake was found.
					Invariably the mistake was assuming some 'obvious' property which turned out to be equivalent to the fifth postulate (Playfair's axiom).</p>
					
					<h3 id="e4">Ditching the 5th Postulate</h3>
					<p>After centuries trying to prove Euclid's fifth postulate without success, some mathematicians began trying to prove it by absurdity.
					If they could could that the other alternatives implied by the fifth postulate were false, then that postulate would be true.
					It was then that they have began to discover new Geometries.</p>

					</figure>
					
					<p>In the beginning of the 19th century, Carl Friedrich Gauss and Ferdinand Karl Schweikart (1813 and 1818 respectively) 
					had the germinal ideas of non-Euclidean geometry worked out, but neither published any results.</p>
					
					<p>Then, around 1830, the Hungarian mathematician János Bolyai and the Russian mathematician Nikolai Ivanovich Lobachevsky 
					separately published treatises on hyperbolic geometry. Consequently, hyperbolic geometry is called Bolyai-Lobachevskian geometry, 
					as both mathematicians, independent of each other, are the basic authors of non-Euclidean geometry.</p>
					
					<p>Later in 1854, Bernhard Riemann, founded the field of Riemannian Geometry in a famous lecture, 
					discussing in particular the ideas now called manifolds, Riemannian metric, and curvature.
					He argued we can do Geometry on any surface, regardless of it's shape, as long as we know how to measure length in this surface. 
					A curve would be measured using calculus, and the distance between two points would be the shortest curve between them.</p>

					<p class="mb-1">Aditionally, the concept of curvature separated the (now infinite) Geometries into three groups:</p><ul>
						<li><a href="euclidean.html">Euclidean</a> or Plane Geometry, which have no curvature \((c = 0)\)</li>
						<li>Elliptic and <a href="spherical.html">Spherical</a> Geometries, which have positive curvature \((c > 0)\)</li>
						<li><a href="hyperbolic.html">Hyperbolic</a> Geometries, which have negative curvature \((c &lt; 0)\)</li>
