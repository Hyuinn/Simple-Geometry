# Simple Geometry
## My First Website
This is first my website, Simple Geometry. Here I will talk about the history and basic ideas regarding non-Euclidean Geometry. To understand that we will look into history and see what defined Euclidean Geometry, as well why and how mathematicians came to the discovery of this new and exciting geometry.

While I agree that the the subject of this site isn't "Simple" in the slightest, my goal here is to try to cover it in the simplest way possible, and hopefully turning this abstract concept into something most people can understand.

All references are linked at the bottom of the index page as well some videos I recommend watching regarding not only the history of it but also how these different Geometries behave without any math pre-requisite.
